# Welcome to the AI-Fish-Simulator wiki!

This is a simulation of an evolutionary AI designed to help fish in a pond get better at finding the food in the pond.

The pond is defined as a 3d array with defined length, defined width, and infinite depth allowing fish and food to stack on top of each other in the pond from a top-down view.

The evolutionary algorithm can be easily modified to simulate faster/slower evolution as desired.

## Current Features:
- pond with modifiable size contains fish and food
- worst 25% of fish will be eliminated from the pond in favor of newly breed fish with better DNA
- run 1 generation
- skip x generations
- data visualization at the end of each round

## Future:
- allow rectangular ponds
- allow user to input a function as the pond size
